title: "Welcome to Traction OS"
description: "Traction OS helps you turn ideas into real progress. It organizes work the way people actually do it: big goals become projects, projects are split into missions (phases), and missions break down into actionable tasks. The app helps you pick the three most important things to do each day so you make steady momentum without overwhelm."

## Quick Tour — What you’ll see

- **Focus** — Your “today” page. Shows up to 3 actions chosen to move your projects forward. Mark them done, swap them if you need, and keep a streak going.
- **Projects** — All your projects with progress bars, mission lists, and actions. Create new projects, edit details, or archive finished work.
- **Quick Capture** — A tiny input to clear a thought from your head. Type a task, idea or plan and the app will sort it for you.
- **Guided Project Intake** — A friendly step-by-step form that helps you describe a project and then automatically generates a simple plan to get started.

## Getting started (3 minutes)

1. **Sign up** or sign in with your email.
2. If this is your first time, click **Projects → New Project** or use the **Create Project** button.
3. The guided intake will ask:
   - What’s your project? (a short title)
   - What does “done” look like? (success criteria)
   - What’s in your head about this project? (brain dump)
   - Any dates? (optional — choose “soft” or “hard” deadline)
4. When you finish the intake, Traction OS will generate a clear, step-by-step plan (missions + actions) so you can start working right away.

## Using Focus (Today’s Work)

- The Focus page shows your **top 3 actions for the day** — the things we think will move your projects forward the most.
- Each action shows:
  - An estimated time (S = ~30m, M = ~60m, L = ~90m)
  - Which project and mission it belongs to
  - A due date if it has one
- **Complete an action** by tapping its checkbox. The app records your completion and helps build a streak for motivation.
- **Swap an action** if you’d rather work on something else: open the swap option and choose from other pending tasks in your projects.

**Why only three?**\
We pick a small number so your day stays realistic. The app balances task size and urgency to give you a focused, achievable plan.

## Projects & Project Plan

- Each project has a clear title, short description, success criteria, and optional deadline (hard or soft).
- Projects are broken into **missions** — the bigger phases — and each mission includes a short list of actions to do next.
- **Project progress** is shown as a simple percentage and a progress bar so you can see momentum at a glance.
- If you’re new to a project, look for the **“Let’s Gain Traction”** button — it helps you start with the most important first steps.

## Quick Capture — capture, don’t forget

- Quick Capture is for anything that pops into your head: tasks, ideas, worries, or small plans.
- After you submit, the app will automatically decide whether your note should become:
  - A quick **Action** to do soon,
  - A new **Mission** inside an existing project, or
  - A brand-new **Project** (if it looks big or complex).
- If the app isn’t confident where your thought belongs, it will put it in your **Inbox** as an unassigned item so you can sort it later.

**Tip:** Use Quick Capture whenever you want a fast, low-friction way to clear your mind — it’s reliable and reversible.

## How the “smart” parts help you

- When you create a project with the guided form, Traction OS uses a helper that turns your answers into a neat plan: a concise title, a short description, success criteria, and a set of missions and actions. Think of it as a friendly project assistant that sketches a sensible plan for you.
- When you Quick Capture, the app uses a careful classifier to decide whether the note is a small task or a bigger project, then places it where it makes sense. It errs on the side of caution — if it’s not sure, it won’t force the item into a project.
- These helpers are there to save time, not to take over your decisions. You can always edit, move, or delete anything the assistant creates.

## Tips & best practices

- **Start with the intake** — spend a few minutes on the guided intake and you’ll have a multi-step plan ready to execute.
- **Keep your daily list realistic** — you’ll get the most satisfaction and momentum from completing 2–3 focused tasks.
- **Use Swap liberally** — swapping lets you adapt your day without losing progress.
- **Capture everything** — the Quick Capture is freeform; don’t worry about wording. The app will help classify it later.
- **Set deadlines thoughtfully** — mark a date as _hard_ only if it really must be done by then. Soft deadlines are good targets.

## Common questions

**Q: How many tasks can I have in Focus?**\
A: The app selects up to **3** focus tasks for the day, chosen to fit what you can realistically do.

**Q: What does “hard” vs “soft” deadline mean?**\
A: A **hard** deadline is a firm “must finish by” date. A **soft** deadline is a target date — important, but not mandatory.

**Q: The app made the wrong call — how do I fix it?**\
A: No problem. Edit the item directly: change its title, move it to another project or mission, or turn it into a project of its own. Quick Capture items in your Inbox are easy to reassign.

**Q: The assistant didn’t attach an action to the correct project.**\
A: The assistant is conservative — it avoids making risky guesses. If it didn’t auto-assign, open the Inbox and assign it yourself.

**Q: Will the app ever delete my data automatically?**\
A: No — the app only changes your data when you act (create, archive, or delete). Archive hides a project from your workspace but does not permanently delete everything unless you choose to remove it.

## Troubleshooting

- **I don’t see my new project after intake** — Check the Projects page. If it still doesn’t appear, reload the page or check your internet connection. If the problem persists, contact support (see below).
- **AI-generated plan looks wrong or incomplete** — You can edit the plan manually. If it’s consistently off, try rewriting your intake with clearer success criteria and more context.
- **Quick Capture created something I don’t want** — Open the Inbox and either delete or reassign the item. Everything the app creates can be edited.

## Privacy & safety (short, plain English)

- **Your account is private.** Items you create belong to your account and won’t be visible to others by default.
- **AI helpers are assistants, not decision-makers.** They suggest and create items to speed you up — you can always edit or remove them.
- If you want a longer privacy statement for your docs site, I can draft one that explains exactly what we store and how we use AI.

## Glossary
